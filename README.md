# RPGwithC#
A project test creating a basic RPG game using Object Orienting Programming.
As proposed by a challenge during the "Women Developer Bootcamp" by Banco Carrefour, using OOP and its concepts, it was created a basic RPG game.

It contains:

--> The possibility of the user choose between two characters: p1 or p2
--> Characteristics of such characters:
  ==>Name
  ==>Type of Hero
  ==>Magic Points;
  ==>Health Points;
  ==>Level
--> Types of attack depending on the Type of Hero.


The code itself is composed using abstraction, encapsulation, polymorfism and inheritance in order to better use the concepts of Object Oriented Programming on dotNet and C#.
